# Starting template

This README will need to contain a description of your project, how to run it, how to set up the development environment, and who worked on it.
This information can be added throughout the course, except for the names of the group members.
Add your own name (do not add the names for others!) to the section below.

## Description of project

This project is a quiz game which aims to bring awareness about responsible energy usage to people in a fun and simple way.

There are both a Singleplayer and a Multiplayer mode. The player gets to answer a set of 20 random questions in a short amount of time, and depending on how many correct answers they've got they receive points.

The multiplayer mode lets the player compete against others by answering questions under time pressure (once again) and using special jokers that gives them advantages:

> DOUBLE SCORE: doubles the score;
> TIME CUT: shrinks the time left to answer a question for everyone;
> WILDCARD: remove one incorrect answer for the card user;

The multiplayer also features emoticons/reactions to provide player interaction and a more competitive atmosphere.
